# Smart Contract Module
- NULSThe smart contract adopts the innovative concept of modular design and incorporates it intoNULSThe module repository allows developers to directly select when building chainsNULSThe smart contract module can complete the relevant configuration.
- NULSSmart contracts enable minute level deployment, allowing developers to quickly deploy them on the chain after writing the smart contract.
- NULSSmart contractNVMIt is based onJVMImplementation,NULSThe smart contract interpreter will seamlessly supportJVMThe system programming language will gradually support other mainstream programming languages, and application developers can use their familiar languages to designNULSSmart contracts.
- Through such innovative design thinking,NULSHope to enable the development of smart contracts„ÄÅDeploying and calling can be more convenient, thereby increasing developers' interest in application development. In the near future, a rich library of smart contracts can be created.
